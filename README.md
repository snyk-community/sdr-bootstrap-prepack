# Spring Data REST Bootstrap prepack

This repo is a [Structor](https://github.com/ipselon/structor) starter project for [Spring Boot](http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/) Web application with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) UI. 

## What can be built with this project?

Choosing this project as a starter project you can easily build a Web application for database CRUD operations with REST interface, authentication, and dynamic and good looking Web UI. 

Here you will find a wide range (which is getting wider day by day) of the components for sophisticated Web UI:
  * Data Grid components with sorting, paging, editing and deleting capabilities,
  * List components for collections,
  * Form components for adding, editing records in collections,
  * Form components for filtering data in collections,
  * Pagination components for the navigation though pages in Data Grids,
  * more than 40 components from popular labraries React Boostrap and React Widgets,
  * many adopted components such as form input elements, navigation through pages and others.

In contrast to majority of the Web apps for database CRUD operations, UI components of the project can display linked entities collections, interact with each other, can search data, has different types of input elements including dropdowns, date calendars and others.

It's worth a mention that all UI components are created and manipulated by a visual builder, which gives an instant feedback about how components look and feel.

All tools and libraries of this project are neatly configured and works perfect with each other, also you will find here a very simple building process of the whole application.

### Prerequisites

* <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html" target="_blank">JDK 8</a>
* <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" target="_blank">NodeJS 4 or 5</a>

Assuming you are familiar with Spring and Sptring Data/Hibernate, React/Redux/React Router.

### Brief tutorial

It is needed to explain that this project is designed to work with Structor, wich has such a nice feature as the source code generators for React components. If you are not familiar with Structor, it is recommended to watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY65e6Ry_rY" target="_blank">this video</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLz8B0XJPyk" target="_blank">this video</a> before starting this tutorial.

#### 3 types of components

There are 3 types of components in Stuctor project:

1. Pre-created components, which have already written source code and can be found in the source code repository of the project
2. Build-in source code generators, which generate the source code from the composition of components on the page. They also can be found in proejct source code.
3. Online source code generators, which generate the source code of the advanced components, such as data grids or forms for RESTful interface. They can be installed into project from [Structor Market](https://helmetrex.com) and behave as they are build-in generators. The only difference is that these generators work if you have an account on Structor Market.
